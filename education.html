<b><li>SEKOLAH KEBANGSAAN SRI SELAMA</li></b>
<br>
<p align="left">I received my first education properly at Sk Sri Selama since I go to pre-school at that school and continue studying there from seven years old until 12 years old. This is the school where I took my UPSR examination and get to know to make friends. I learn a lot of new things when I was in primary school such as how to make friends, learn how to read and write, learn how to be a good student as well as others. I would say that my primary school is where I get to build my character as a kid and I am blessed that I managed to create good memories while studying there.

<br>
<b><li>SEKOLAH MENGENGAH KEBANGSAAN DATO' HAJI HUSSEIN</li></b>
<br>
<p align="left">Then, when I turned 13 years old, I changed school as I need to go to the <abbr title="Sekolah Mengengah Kebangsaan Dato Haji Hussein">SMKDHH</abbr> for my secondary school. I studied there from 13 years old until 17 years old. I took both PT3 and SPM examinations at this school. My secondary school taught me a variety of things such as communication, engagement with people, friendship, and of course education. I believe I have changed to a better student when I entered my secondary school since I already experienced school life during my primary school, therefore, I know how to make friends, how to ask for the teacher's help, etc. As for my secondary school, I would say it taught me about a variety of things such as responsibilities, the importance of friends, and others including proper education. It was a nice journey for me during secondary school at SMKDHH. </p>

<p align="left">Currently, I am furthering my studies in Diploma in Information Management at <abbr title="UiTM Kedah">UiTM</abbr> since I was 18 years old and planning to keep further my studies to the highest level of education in order to be someone educated and successful.
