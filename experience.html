<font size="6" align="center"><b>Helping my father's business</b></font>
<br>
<font size="5"><p align="left">The business that my father do is selling Ikan Pekasam and there are many people love to eat Ikan Pekasam as their side dish as it can be eaten with a variety of food such as rice, porridge, and others. As someone who lives in Perak which is located on the north side of Malaysia, I believe Ikan Pekasam is a good choice to start a business since it is famous side for us in the northern region and in demand by people who live far such as Johor and Melaka.The selling method is offline where people may contact my father and I through WhatsApp and Facebook to order and they need to pick up the Ikan Pekasam at my house by themselves or I will do the delivery only on weekends. My father use his personal social media which is WhatsApp and Instagram to promote and attract customer to buy his product and created a facebook page for his product as a medium to promote his product and I am the one who handle the account. </p></font>
<font size="5"><p align="left">We're selling 1kg ikan pekasam for RM20.00 and the best part of being an entrepreneur is that when we received good feedback regarding the fish from the customer and when the customer started to repeat the order. As a matter of fact, many customers prefer to pick up the ikan pekasam at our house rather than delivery. We're beyond gratefuI as we always get different customers every day and the fact that our customer always want to repeat order with us. It is satisfying when we get to satisfy customer need and taste.During my journey helping my father do his business, I've gained and experienced a lot of things. I've learned that it is hard to earn money and hard to be an entrepreneur since as an entrepreneur, we cannot be shy and must be brave. This business opportunity has taught me to trust and believe in my capabilities to be an entrepreneur and to not give up. I've noticed that I have the courage to be an entrepreneur, therefore, I need to strive for my business in the future to succeed as well as strive to be a successful entrepreneur who is able to open her own shop. </p></font>
